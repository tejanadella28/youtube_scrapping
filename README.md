# YouTube Web Scraping Project

This project involves a Python-based web scraper developed to collect video data from YouTube. The scraper uses **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** to extract important video details, such as title, views, likes, and comments. The collected data can then be analyzed for insights and trends.

## Features
- Scrapes YouTube video data such as title, views, likes, and comments.
- Uses **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML and **Selenium** for dynamic content loading.
- Data can be exported to a CSV or Excel file for further analysis.
- Simple to set up and run with minimal dependencies.

- Libraries:
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `selenium`
  - `pandas`
  - `requests` (for handling HTTP requests)
